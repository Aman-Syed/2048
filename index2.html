        <div id="three">2048 is a game where you combine numbered tiles in order to gain a higher numbered tile.
             In this game you start with two tiles, the lowest possible number available is two. <br>
             Then you will play by combining the tiles with the same number to have a tile with the sum of the number on the two tiles. 
             After, achieving the tile with a 2048 tile,
             players can still continue.<br> Some stop there, but others are determined to continue.
            The game of 2048 does not include complicated controls. 
            The controls youâ€™ll be using are just upward, downward, and sideways. <br><br>
            The rules are also simple.<br><br>
             You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box.
              When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them,
               they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially.</div>
